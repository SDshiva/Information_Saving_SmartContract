# Secure User Information Storage on the Blockchain

# Project Overview:

"Secure User Information Storage on the Blockchain" is a blockchain-based application that provides a secure and decentralized method for storing and retrieving user information. This project leverages blockchain technology to ensure the utmost data security and integrity.

# Key Features:

User Data Storage: The application allows users to input their sensitive information. This data is converted into a secure hash code, ensuring privacy and security.

Data Retrieval: Users can access their stored information by providing the hash code through the project's website. This retrieval process is quick, efficient, and secure.

Blockchain-Based: The project is built on the blockchain, which ensures the immutability and integrity of stored user data. All transactions are transparent and tamper-proof.

Metamask Integration: To interact with the website, users are required to connect their Metamask wallet. This manual connection enhances security and establishes trust between users and the application.

Smart Contract: The project utilizes a smart contract written in Solidity, enabling seamless execution of transactions on the blockchain. The contract is deployed using Remix IDE, a reputable online Integrated Development Environment for Solidity.
